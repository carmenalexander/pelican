This was the day of the England versus West Germany World Cup match,
so it seemed like a good idea to go for a walk. I couldn't persuade
anyone else to come out with me so decided the visit Cwm Cywarch,
where I have never been before. I also wanted to climb Aran Fawddwy,
which would be another first for me.
