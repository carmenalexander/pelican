This is the second attempt to port Pelican to Python 3.

The first used 2to3 and manually corrections to achieve
syntactical correctness. But as the tests show, more subtle
bugs in the string handling (e.g. outputting b'...' instead of
'...') remain.

Also the code was suitable for Python 3 only.

In this second attempt, I'll try to apply changes 2to3 would have made
carefully manually, and also try to stay compatible with Python 2
syntax.
