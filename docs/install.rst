Installing Pelican
##################

Pelican currently runs best on Python 2.7.x and 3.5+; earlier versions of
Python are not supported.

Once Pelican is installed, you can run ``pelican --help`` to see basic usage
options. For more detail, refer to the :doc:`Publish<publish>` section.

You can install Pelican via several different methods. The simplest is via
`pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::

    pip install pelican

Keep in mind that operating systems will often require you to prefix the above
command with ``sudo`` in order to install Pelican system-wide. **You should
not do this** as it may break your operating system. In this case you 
can add the ``--user`` flag or try one of the recommended methods below.

**Recommended method 1:** `pipx <https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx/>`_

pipx lets you execute binaries from Python packages in isolated environments.
You can install pipx according to instructions on its  
`homepage <https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx/>`_. After pipx is installed,
you can install pelican::

    $ pipx install pelican
    installed package pelican 4.0.1, Python 3.6.7
    These binaries are now globally available
     - pelican
     - pelican-import
     - pelican-quickstart
     - pelican-themes
    done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨

To upgrade or uninstall::

    pipx upgrade pelican
    pipx uninstall pelican

**Recommended method 2:** Virtual Environment

If you prefer to manually manage a Virtual Environment, you can create 
a virtual environment for Pelican via venv_ (or virtualenv_ if you are 
using Python2) before installing Pelican.::

    python -m venv ~/virtualenvs/pelican
    . ~/virtualenvs/pelican/bin/activate

Once the virtual environment has been created and activated, Pelican can be
installed via ``pip install pelican`` as noted above. Alternatively, if you
have the project source, you can install Pelican using the distutils method::

    cd path-to-Pelican-source
    python setup.py install

If you have Git installed and prefer to install the latest bleeding-edge
version of Pelican rather than a stable release, use the following command::

    pip install -e "git+https://github.com/getpelican/pelican.git#egg=pelican"

To exit the virtual environment, type ``deactivate``.

Optional packages
-----------------

If you plan on using `Markdown <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown>`_ as a
markup format, you'll need to install the Markdown library::

    pip install Markdown

Typographical enhancements can be enabled in your settings file, but first the
requisite `Typogrify <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/typogrify>`_ library must be
installed::

    pip install typogrify
    
If you are using pipx, you can inject packages into the pipx-managed virtual
environment::

    pipx inject pelican Markdown

Dependencies
------------

When Pelican is installed, the following dependent Python packages should be
automatically installed without any action on your part:

* `feedgenerator <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/feedgenerator>`_, to generate the
  Atom feeds
* `jinja2 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Jinja2>`_, for templating support
* `pygments <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pygments>`_, for syntax highlighting
* `docutils <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/docutils>`_, for supporting
  reStructuredText as an input format
* `pytz <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz>`_, for timezone definitions
* `blinker <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/blinker>`_, an object-to-object and
  broadcast signaling system
* `unidecode <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Unidecode>`_, for ASCII
  transliterations of Unicode text
* `six <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/six>`_,  for Python 2 and 3 compatibility
  utilities
* `MarkupSafe <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MarkupSafe>`_, for a markup safe
  string implementation
* `python-dateutil <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-dateutil>`_, to read
  the date metadata

Upgrading
---------

If you installed a stable Pelican release via ``pip`` and wish to upgrade to
the latest stable release, you can do so by adding ``--upgrade``::

    pip install --upgrade pelican

If you installed Pelican via distutils or the bleeding-edge method, simply
perform the same step to install the most recent version.

If you installed with pipx::

    pipx upgrade pelican

Kickstart your site
-------------------

Once Pelican has been installed, you can create a skeleton project via the
``pelican-quickstart`` command, which begins by asking some questions about
your site::

    pelican-quickstart

Once you finish answering all the questions, your project will consist of the
following hierarchy (except for *pages* â€” shown in parentheses below â€” which
you can optionally add yourself if you plan to create non-chronological
content)::

    yourproject/
    â”œâ”€â”€ content
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (pages)
    â”œâ”€â”€ output
    â”œâ”€â”€ tasks.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile
    â”œâ”€â”€ pelicanconf.py       # Main settings file
    â””â”€â”€ publishconf.py       # Settings to use when ready to publish

The next step is to begin to adding content to the *content* folder that has
been created for you.
