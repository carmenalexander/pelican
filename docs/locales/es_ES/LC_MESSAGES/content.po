"**Be careful when linking to a file from multiple documents:** Since the first "
"link to a file finalizes its location and Pelican does not define the order in "

"documents can cause its location to change from one site build to the next. "
"(Whether this happens in practice will depend on the operating system, file "
"system, version of Pelican, and documents being added, modified, or removed "
"from the project.) Any external sites linking to the file's old location might "
"then find their links broken. **It is therefore advisable to use {attach} only "
"if you use it in all links to a file, and only if the linking documents share a "
"single directory.** Under these conditions, the file's output location will not "
"change in future builds. In cases where these precautions are not possible, "
"consider using ``{static}`` links instead of ``{attach}``, and letting the "
"file's location be determined by the project's ``STATIC_SAVE_AS`` and "
