# This tests the unified codebase (py26-py32) of Pelican.
# depends on some external libraries that aren't released yet.
#
# To run Pelican, you will already have checked out and installed them.
#
# Now we must tell tox about this package, otherwise tox would load the old
# libraries from PyPi.
#
# Run tox from the libraries source tree. It will save its package in
# the distshare directory from where the tests here will pick it up.
#
# Do that for
# https://github.com/dmdm/smartypants.git
#
# and typogrify:
# https://github.com/dmdm/typogrify/tree/py3k
#
# CAVEAT:
# -------
#
# Please be aware that my port of typogrify is just 2to3'd.
# It is not backwards compatible with Python 2.
