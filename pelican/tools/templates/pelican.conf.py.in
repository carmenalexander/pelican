# The settings defined in this configuration file

# Feed settings
#################

# The domain to prepend to feed URLs.

# define this. If you have already defined SITEURL and want to use
# the same domain for your feeds, you can do:
#FEED_DOMAIN = SITEURL
#FEED_DOMAIN = "http://feeds.example.com/"

# By default, Pelican uses Atom feeds. This sets the relative
# URL to the sitewide Atom feed. Set to None for no atom feed.
#FEED = 'feeds/all.atom.xml'

# RSS feeds can also be generated. This sets the relative
# URL to the sitewide RSS feed. Set to None for no RSS feed.
#FEED_RSS = None

# Pelican also generates category atom feeds.
# This sets their location; %s is the name of the category.
#CATEGORY_FEED = 'feeds/%s.atom.xml'

# %s is the name of the category.
#CATEGORY_FEED_RSS = None  # Don't generate RSS feeds

# By default, Pelican does not generate tag feeds.

# feed location; %s is the tag name.
#TAG_FEED = None

#LOCALE = ('usa', 'jpn',  # On Windows

#LOCALE = ()

# Specify a different date format for each language.
# This is a dict with language as keys and strftime strings as values.

##############
# Pagination
##############

# By default, Pelican will list all article titles along with
# a short description on the index page. However, for large
# blogs it is helpful to paginate this list. Setting this
# to an integer sets the maximum number of articles on a page.

# Then, set the maximum number of tags in the cloud
